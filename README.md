The API is a robust platform designed for comprehensive domain and web services management. Built on **RESTful architecture**, this means our API follows standard conventions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources using HTTP methods, making integration and consumption straightforward and efficient.

The base URL for all API requests is [https://www.webb.se/api2/](https://www.webb.se/api2/). To make API calls, you will need an API key. You can generate this key from our control panel at [https://www.webb.se/kontrollpanel/](https://www.webb.se/kontrollpanel/). When making requests, clients are required to use this API key with basic authentication, paired with their username.

With our API, users can effectively manage domain names, handle DNS and DNSSEC configurations, and control associated resources like SSL certificates, redirects, and email configurations. It also supports the creation, modification, and deletion of resources such as databases, cron jobs, and websites. Specialized services like TMCH, blocks, and premium DNS are further available. Moreover, the API encompasses tools for domain probing, thread management, and economic functionalities. In addition to the aforementioned features, it offers tools for account administration, including billing, security, and API key management.
