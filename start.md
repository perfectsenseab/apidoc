The API is a robust platform designed for comprehensive domain and web services management. Built on **RESTful architecture**, our API follows standard conventions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources using HTTP methods. This makes the integration and consumption straightforward and efficient.

## Making Requests

The base URL for all API requests is [https://www.webb.se/api2/](https://www.webb.se/api2/). When making requests, clients should use their API key with basic authentication, paired with their username.
